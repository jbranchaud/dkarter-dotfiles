# Personal Brewfile Template
#
# This is a template for maintaining your own copy of the Brewfile on your
# personal branch. This approach gives you full control over what gets installed
# while keeping the upstream Brewfile unchanged (avoiding merge conflicts).
#
# Setup (on your personal branch):
#   1. Copy this file: cp Brewfile.personal.example Brewfile.personal
#   2. Edit Brewfile.personal - remove packages you don't want, add your own
#   3. Commit: git add Brewfile.personal && git commit -m "feat: add personal Brewfile"
#
# The setup and sync scripts will automatically use Brewfile.personal if it exists,
# falling back to the main Brewfile if it doesn't.
#
# Staying in sync with upstream:
#   - Use scripts/check_brewfile_changes.sh to detect upstream Brewfile changes
#   - Manually review and merge desired changes into your Brewfile.personal
#
# Note: You can still use Brewfile.local for additional packages on top of
# Brewfile.personal (useful for machine-specific packages).
